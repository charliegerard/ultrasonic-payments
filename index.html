      <h1>Ultrasonic payment demo</h1>
      <h2>
        An experiment in using acoustic data transmission to send a Stripe
        payment link via ultrasounds.
      </h2>
      <p>
        A website is open on both a merchant's device (e.g. an iPad) and a
        customer's device (e.g. a phone). The merchant's device acts as the
        transmitter and the customer's device as the receiver.
      </p>

      <p>
        To try this demo, you need 2 devices. On each device, visit this website
        and select either "merchant" or "customer" from the links below:
